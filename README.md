# üéØ Goal: Logic and Propositions

## Objective

This week our goal is "Proof terms and tactics" which is an
opportunity to "look under the hood" and understand better what Lean
is doing in the background.  What are tactics?  What are "terms" and
how does exhibiting a term of a certain type "prove" anything?

This problem set is designed to be a bit shorter, in part to provide a
bit of a breather and let us all catch up before next week when we dig
deeper into mathematical applications.

## üöÄ Getting Started: Your Step-by-Step Guide

Setting up a new environment often takes more time than expected, so let's break it down into manageable steps.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Accept the GitHub Classroom Assignment

Accept this homework assignment in GitHub Classroom. This will enable
you to clone your own repository.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

Once the assignment is accepted, clone your new repository to your
local machine.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Project Setup

Follow the [official guide for setting up an existing Lean
project](https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/project.html)
to set up your development environment.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Fetch Prebuilt Dependencies

Run the following command to fetch the pre-built `mathlib` files. This is significantly faster than building `mathlib` on your local machine:

```bash
lake exe cache get
```
